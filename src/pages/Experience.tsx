              I&apos;m a software engineer specializing in front-end
              development, but with experience in middleware and back-end
              development. I enjoy bringing designs from concept to
              implementation.
              <br />
              <br />
              I quit my first job out of college after a year (analyst for a consulting firm in Washington, DC) and 
              did a complete 180Â° by going back to school to chase my dream of becoming a software developer. After most
              of an Associates of Engineering, a competitive internship program with <> </>
               <Link target='_blank' href='https://joinforge.co/'>Forge</Link>, and 4 years of development at a now-defunct solar company
              transitioning out of the startup phase, I've developed a powerful love for frontend development.
              <br />
              <br />
              Right now I&apos;m interested in practicing TypeScript, remaning fresh with hooks, and learning as much as
               I can about dockerization, and picking up new skills and experience wherever I can.
